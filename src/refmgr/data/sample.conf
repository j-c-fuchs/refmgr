# Define the BibTeX key formats. For each entry type, you can add an
# option <type>_key, e.g., article_key, book_key etc. (note the lower
# case). Values in curly brackets are expanded by the entry fields,
# e.g., {year} gets replaced by '2020' if the entry contains
# 'year = {2020}'. Other letters are printed as they are. A notable
# exception is the 'author' field, though: Here, only the last names are
# used separated by '_'. Note that there are additional fields availabe
# which are generated automatically, namely:
# 'original_key' - the original key (i.e., don't modify the key)
# 'firstauthor' - only the (last name of the) first author
# 'author_maxN' - (last names of the) first N authors or the first
#                 author followed by 'et al'; only for N < 100
# 'author_maxN_' - like 'autho_maxN_' but with all first N authors
#                  followed by 'et al'
# 'shortjournal' - use shortjournal or journal if shortjournal is not
#                  available
# 'shortjournal_' - like 'shortjournal' but removes all dots
#article_key = {year}-{journal}-{_author_max3}
